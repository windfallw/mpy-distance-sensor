# mpy-distance-sensor

*MicroPython library for TOF (time-of-flight) distance sensor.*


> What’s TOF is pulsed laser emits pulse singly or continuously to the target. When emitting laser pulse, internal timing circuit is triggered instantly. The calculator measures the time between the laser pulse arriving at the target and return to the receiver from the target Δt , so the distance of the target is obtained.
